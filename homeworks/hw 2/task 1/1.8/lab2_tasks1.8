1) “What are three of the primary responsibilities of a UIView object?”
--Drawing and animation
Views draw content in their rectangular area using UIKit or Core Graphics.
You can animate some view properties to new values.
--Layout and subview management
Views may contain zero or more subviews.
Views can adjust the size and position of their subviews.
Use Auto Layout to define the rules for resizing and repositioning your views in response to changes in the view hierarchy
--Event handling
A view is a subclass of UIResponder and can respond to touches and other types of events.
Views can install gesture recognizers to handle common gestures.

2) “What does documentation call a view that’s embedded in another view?”
Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship 
between the host view (known as the superview) and the embedded view (known as the subview).

3) “What does documentation call the parent view that’s embedding the other view?”
A parent view may contain any number of subviews, but each subview has only one superview. 
By default, when a subview’s visible area extends outside of the 
bounds of its superview, no clipping of the subview's content occurs

4)“What is a view’s frame?” 5)“How is a view’s bounds different from its frame?”
The frame and bounds properties define the geometry of each view. 
The frame property defines the origin and dimensions of the view in the 
coordinate system of its superview. The bounds property defines the internal 
dimensions of the view as it sees them, and its use is almost exclusive to custom 
drawing code. The center property provides a convenient way to reposition a view
 without changing its frame or bounds properties directly.
